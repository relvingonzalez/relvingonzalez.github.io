Turista App by Relvin Gonzalez

This app is based on CodeAcademy's NearMe App. But this is my new and improved version. 
It uses the actual user's geolocation instead of having some random hardcoded coordinates.
It uses the $q service to get the user's geolocation before showing the map with the markers.


This app uses the Wikipedia api to produce a JSON with all the links to wikipedia and coordinates
of important or touristic places near the user. The user is the red marker, touristic places are the blue markers.
