I recommend him highly and will work with him again." - enhancements on AngularJS and a complete overhaul of the app into ReactJS. Large startup with millions in revenue.

                “Relvin is the most reliable AngularJS coder on Upwork. He gets into the job fully, communicates well, delivers quality work and is a friendly person. A real asset for any JS project! This was my 3rd job with him, perfect!" - Survey app for big-name car brand dealerships. Written in AngularJS using Indexed DB as offline storage.
